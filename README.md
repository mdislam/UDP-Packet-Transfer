UDP-Packet-Transfer
===================

A simple Server and Client communication by transferring UDP packet has been implemented in the same host machine. The purpose of this implementation is to record different time-stamps such as UDP packet sending time-stamp, receiving time-stamp and measure packet transfer time and delay overheads from these records.
